After a period focused on the deepening of GoLang, for the next days I will resume the front-end side with the reading of the book by [Luca Mezzalira](https://twitter.com/lucamezzalira) just released in its first edition published by O'Reilly: [Building Micro-Frontends](https://www.buildingmicrofrontends.com/).

It may be that I begin to define one or two projects concerning micro-frontends and custom elements; at the moment they are just an idea that I have had for a while, maybe the right time has come.

I have also resumed integrating my repo on github ["notes"](https://github.com/sandrolain/notes) where I am collecting notes and references to libraries and resources that I consider useful.


For now I will think about relaxing and having a good time with my family.

## Merry Christmas and Happy New Year
